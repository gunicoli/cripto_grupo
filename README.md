Cripto Group is a Brazilian start-up company based in Sao Paulo - Brazil. 
We are an international crypto hedge fund offering a legally established investment product directed at international investors currently looking to acquire exposure to a cripto investment fund which is currently offered in 3 versions: conservative, risk-neutral and bullish. 

Each fund follows its own guidelines which can be found here, 

Conservative
This fund offers an investment approached aimed at capital preservation. The investment strategies pertaining to this fund are those resembling mutual funds such as mortgage-backed securities with predetermined schedule of payments

Risk Neutral 
The risk neutral fund pools the 10 biggest cripto currencies on the market and uses an artificial intelligence based proprietary model to rebalance the portfolio on weekly basis 

Aggressive
The aggresive investment is a premium service offered by the Cripto Grupo for those clients interested in establishing exclusively managed funds

Cripto Grupo is the only private registered company in Brazil focusing on developing Web 2.0, Web 3.0 and mobile applications. 
Our knowledge of finance intertwined with our ever increasing approach to artificial intelligence, machine learning and such areas put us in a pole position to consolidate our brand as the cripto service of choice. 

The investment fund product will be the company's first product launch and we are currently editing the files to provide a framework for future contribution. Given the team's financial background I have structured Cripto Grupo to be launched as a private investment made by the community in the community by means of pooling together pools of developers to growth-enabled cripto cripto regions such as Brazil where we will likely have bitcoin regulated by the end of 2018, with no mention being made to altcoins until 09/08/2018. 

The investment funds available will have their resources allocated in 3 different pools, each representing the investor's style. 
Every month we will have a new fund being launched and the conversion period occurs on the 1st of each month, with a fee being charged for express conversion.
